	<h1>Subject: Lab3</h1>
	<p>In this lab, we are utilizing the skills we learned from last
	week's lecture to create and develop our very own webpage. </p>
	<h2>Challenges Encountered</h2>
	<p>Other than finding a lab partner to work with on the labs, I have
	not encountered any problems at the moment. </p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>We are successful! I hope that y'all are able to read my index html on
	the server! <p>
