	<h1>Subject: Lab4</h1>
	<p>In this lab, we are creating our own pseudocode of computer tasks </p>
	<h2>Challenges Encountered</h2>
	<p>Other than finding a lab partner to work with on the labs, I have
	not encountered any problems at the moment. </p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>We are successful! I hope that y'all are able to read my index html on
	the server! <p>

		//Creating a blackjack game
		  //Print out a statement that prompts the user to pass or add a card.
		  //Accept the user output.
		    //If the user’s hand is over 21, the player loses.
		    //Else, if the user’s hand is under 21, prompt the user to pass or add a card to their hand.
		  //Repeat step 3.
		    //If the user decides to pass, the computer must do the same with steps 1-5.
		    //If the player and computer decides to pass, compare both hands.
		  //If the player 's hand is greater than the computer's hand, then the player wins.
		  //Else, if the computer’s hnd is greater than the player’s hand, then the computer wins.
		  //Prompt the player to play again.
