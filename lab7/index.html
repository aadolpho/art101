		<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
		<p>In this lab, we are learning how to use and create functions in JavaScript </p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I've turned in this lab late. Other than that, I think this lab was
		pretty okay. I tried to make a duplicate file from lab6 and rename it to lab7,
    but ran into some issues of displaying information. I also didn't have a partner
    for this lab as well.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>If you are able to read my index html file, then it made it on the server
		successfully! Here is my program execution! <p>
